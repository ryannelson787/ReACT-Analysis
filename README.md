This project stores the codebase and data for the research project ReACT Analysis.

Each ReACT script has a function, compute_reactX(). This function takes in, as a parameter, the full name of a GitHub repository (i.e. ryannelson787/ReACT-Analysis). In order to run each ReACT script, you can import the function into your own script or modify the original script at the bottom with your desired tests, then call compute_reactX(full_name) with your desired repository. The script measuring sustainability is in sustainability_script.py, and is run similarly to each ReACT.
